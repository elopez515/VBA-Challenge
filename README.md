# VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

In this project I was given the task of analyzing the stock market data for years 2014, 2015, and 2016.

In order to do so I created a VBA script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

It will also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
